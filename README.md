# Eurorack_Power_Cable_Accessories
A set of tools for making eurorack power cables a little easier. Consisting of a Crimp Tool Stand, a fixed length Crimp Tool Nest, and a Cable Splitter

## Crimp Tool Stand
The crimp tool stand is designed to be used with the Pro's Kit 6PK-214 crimp tool, and is a stand to hold the tool vertically on the table while aranging the connector and ribbon cable. It clips into place with a little bit of force, and generally lives on the tool. There are three versions, the original short one, the long one which is much more balanced, and the tall one, which I've yet to print or use. 

## Crimp Tool Nest
This is a nest for use with the same tool, Pro's Kit 6PK-214, to help space multiple 10 position ends on the end of a single cable. This is particularly useful if you have multiple 1U modules in a 3U row, such as the case with Bib, Buzzrito, and Blueberry. This particular model is made for a 95mm pitch between end cables, and can be easily digitally cut and rejoined for other lengths.

## Cable Splitter
### Use at your own risk. I think the Cable Splitter is great, but knives are sharp and dangerous, and never force a knife, unless you want to lose blood.
Eurorack power cables are not as flexible as I'd like, especially when building in shallow skiffs or with many smaller modules close together. By separating the ribbon into groups of 2 or 3 wires, the cablees become much more flexible. Doing this by hand risks digging into the insulation, and tends to leave a ragged edge when torn. The Cable Splitter is a 2 part print that fits around 10 position IDC ribbon cable and guides a utility blade knife into the correct position to separate the +/-12 volts from the ground, and split the ground into two groups of 3, leaving a much more flexible cable to route in your case.
